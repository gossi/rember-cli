# rember-cli

A clone of Ember-CLI written in Rust.

## What this is

I am currently learning Rust and I'm honestly not good at it.

So, as a learning project I'm creating a clone of Ember CLI in Rust.

Expect the code to be awful - I'm learning as I go...

## What this is not

* Stable
* An official project
* A replacement of Ember CLI

## How to install

`cargo install rember`

Supported features:

`rember new project-name` will generate a new Ember application.
